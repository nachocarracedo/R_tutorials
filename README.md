## R TUTORIALs

This project containts several R tutorials. I created these tutorials as a repository I can use to refresh my memory for some of the R libraries. All of the tutorials use the college scorecard data set (https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/):

* clustering_tutorial
* eda_ggplot2_tutorial	
* knn_dt_stne_tutorial
* NLP_tutorial

Enjoy!
